// CapabilityPolicyEngine — decides which capabilities Passport will grant, deny, and gate.
//
// The rule, fail-closed by construction:
//   allowed   = requested capabilities that are NOT side-effecting and NOT globally forbidden
//   denied    = every side-effecting / forbidden capability the plan could touch
//   approvals = the commit capabilities the plan will attempt (denied to the agent, but each
//               can be unlocked once by an explicit human approval — and even then is simulated)
//
// So the agent is granted only discovery + drafting power; anything that affects the outside
// world is denied to it and reachable solely through a per-action approval.
